# Adding a prose rule or a word

Phrase additions are data changes. New structural scanners need code and regression tests.
Requires Node.js 18 or newer; report interpreter absence instead of substituting a manual scan.

This covers the **prose** rules. A TypeScript rule is code, not data: write it against the
[Oxlint plugin API](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/writing-js-plugins.html) in
`scripts/oxlint/rules/`, with a fixture pair beside it in `scripts/oxlint/fixtures/`. The suite
discovers both: a rule with no fixture pair fails the build, and a fixture pair with no rule fails
it too.

Word and phrase rules live in the `patterns` array of
[`scripts/prose-lint.json`](../scripts/prose-lint.json). Add an object, run the self-test, done.

## The loop

```bash
# 1. edit scripts/prose-lint.json
# 2. prove the entry works
node <skill-dir>/scripts/prose_lint.mjs --self-test
# 3. run it on real prose
node <skill-dir>/scripts/prose_lint.mjs docs/*.md
```

`--self-test` runs every example in the file and exits 1 if any is wrong. Pattern examples
must fire under their own identity; a sibling pattern in the same rule cannot earn credit. It is the whole safety net:
an entry whose own example does not fire is not a rule, and an entry that fires on its own
counter-example is a false-positive generator.

## The smallest possible entry

Three fields. `id`, `match`, and one example that must fire.

```json
{
  "id": "smoking-gun",
  "match": "smoking gun",
  "instead": "state the evidence and what it proves",
  "fires": ["That log line is the smoking gun."],
  "passes": []
}
```

`match` may be a plain phrase or a regular expression. Either way it gets word boundaries, so
`seams?` matches "seam" and "seams" and not "seamless". That default is deliberate: without it every
entry silently becomes a substring search, which is the fastest way to make a wordlist useless.

## The field that does the real work: `unless`

Most words worth flagging have a legitimate technical use, and a bare list fires on correct prose.
`unless` lists words that, appearing in the same sentence, mean the term is being used properly.

```json
{
  "id": "seam",
  "match": "seams?",
  "unless": ["test", "testing", "refactor", "legacy", "inject", "substitute"],
  "instead": "name the boundary: the module, the interface, or the file it runs along",
  "fires": ["The seam between the two services is where it gets messy."],
  "passes": ["A seam lets you change behaviour without editing the code under test."]
}
```

A "seam" in Michael Feathers' sense is a real term of art. A "load-bearing wall" is a real thing.
The entry has to let those through, and `passes` is where you prove it does.

**Write the `passes` example first.** Thinking of the legitimate use is what stops the entry being a
blunt ban, and if you cannot think of one — `smoking gun`, `north star`, `secret sauce` — then an
empty `passes` array is the honest answer and the word can be flagged everywhere.

## Quoted phrase mentions are skipped

A document about writing quotes the writing it describes. Anything inside double quotation marks is
skipped by phrase checks, so a style guide can name them. Publication residue inspects original
bytes; raw local-policy entries also inspect quotations and code.

## Which rule an entry reports as

`rule` picks the bucket, and defaults to `no-empty-metaphor`.

| Rule | Severity | For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `no-empty-metaphor` | warning | A metaphor standing in for a mechanism: `load-bearing`, `seam`, `smoking gun` |
| `no-ai-tell` | info | A structural tic that carries no information: negative parallelism, empty pivots |

To add a bucket, add an object to `rules` with an `id`, `severity`, `message`, `next`, `never`, and
a `fixtures` pair. Then point entries at it with `"rule": "<id>"`.

## Fields

| Field | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | yes | Names the entry. Appears as `pattern` in JSON and self-test output |
| `match` | yes | A phrase, or a regular expression if it contains regex syntax |
| `fires` | yes | Sentences that must produce a finding. At least one |
| `passes` | no | Sentences that must not. Empty means the term has no legitimate use |
| `unless` | no | Words that exempt the sentence when present |
| `instead` | no | Fills the `Do:` clause. Say what to write instead |
| `rule` | no | Which bucket to report under. Defaults to `no-empty-metaphor` |
| `boundaries` | no | Set `false` only for a pattern that must end on punctuation. Word boundaries are added by default, which is what keeps `seams?` from matching "seamless" |

## What not to add

**Do not add fashionable vocabulary.** `delve`, `tapestry`, `testament` turn over with each model
generation and are wrong within a year. One is included as a worked example; the rest of the
`no-ai-tell` patterns are *shapes* rather than words, because construction is more informative than a fashionable word list. Both need review as
conventions and legitimate uses change. If you add a
vocabulary entry, expect to delete it.

**Do not add a word you cannot write a `fires` example for.** If you cannot produce a sentence where
it is wrong, the entry is a preference rather than a rule.

**Do not raise these above `warning`.** Vocabulary and phrasing rules are the weakest signals in this
skill and they must never gate a build. Evidence rules and publication residue can fail a check; advisory phrase/rhythm findings should
remain review prompts. Local policy is explicit; see [prose.md](prose.md).

**Do not describe any of this as AI detection.** These are writing defects. A human writes them too,
and tools that classify authorship misfire badly on writing by people whose first language is not
English. The rule says a sentence reaches for an image instead of naming a mechanism. It says
nothing about who wrote it.

## Adding a rule that needs code

Three of the rules — `no-unsupported-claim`, `no-time-estimate`, and the pattern engine itself —
are functions in `prose_lint.mjs`, because they combine several conditions rather than matching one
phrase. Add one the same way the others are built: a `check*` function returning findings, called
from `checkText`, with its vocabulary in the `words` block and its examples in `fixtures`.

The bar for reaching for code: **a single pattern with an `unless` guard cannot express it.** Almost
everything worth adding can be.
